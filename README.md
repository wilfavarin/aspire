# ASPIRE

### Project Summary

ASPIRE is a large multinational organisation based around the globe that maintains an open and supportive company ethos and has created a unique set of brand values which echo a “people first” ambition both in the services it provides, how it treats its customers and how employees at ASPIRE should feel as part of the company.

## Project Brief

The key headlines of the ASPIRE project brief are:

1. WHAT: A Learning & Development corporate website.
2. WHO: All employees working for ASPIRE, at all levels of the business organisation.
3. WHY: Support and enrich employee experience and HR workflow systems by providing a “one stop shop” for all training, development and company information / brand values.
4. HOW: Both seasoned and new employees have different focuses when using this L&D site. It is ASPIRE’s ambition to make sure that we support employees at every step of their career, from the offset with an effective “onboarding” process, (providing as much information surrounding the company as possible and the organisational structure and procedures) and throughout an employee’s career (supporting career development, opportunities to grow and unique new ways to gain training and insight).

Some other key working principles, to be incorporated into the website include:

* Learn at your own pace: 
Self Guided courses that can be accessed anytime and anywhere.
* Maximise Proficiency: 
Deepen knowledge and hone skills by taking functional and technical training.
* Gain Insight: 
Courses and information designed with employees in mind to enable personal and professional growth.

## Project Details

### UI

Crucially, the ASPIRE L&D website must support a simple and thoughtful design which empowers all its employees, enables them to further advance their own career development, enrich and enhance their understanding of the company brand values and experience. 

The colour scheme shown below makes use of gradients and it was chosen to keep things very simple and minimal yet professional. Green represents the colour of growth, balance and tranquility and the mix makes up for a clean look and feel and fresh design.

The font *Source Sans Pro* was picked to be used throughout the whole website. It is a good typography which looks formal and it is believed to attract and hold the user’s attention.
 
Buttons will be distinctly displayed and labelled to make it easy for users to see where they have to click to progress through the website.

It is important that information in relation to learning, onboarding and training are available in a simple, yet comprehensive way on the ASPIRE L&D site. Employees should feel enriched by the experience and find information easily accessible to them.

### UX

In order to support the above key principles, the ASPIRE website must have a clean “look and feel” which echoes the ASPIRE brand values and protocols. Finding and accessing information must be simple, seamless and enjoyable. 

The aim is to develop a user experience which encourages employees to find out more, engage on a higher level with the company and website and enrich their career through the multiple opportunities and databases available to them via the relevant portals and training available.

### Features

Some of the key structural elements include:

1. Trainings: 
* Onboarding: designed with new hires in mind, provides focused onboarding information to get them up to speed on company’s culture, benefits and more.
* Functional and Technical: allows users to take trainings related to the core competencies of their role.
2. Seminars: allows users to register for in-person discussion sessions with an aim to learn, gain insight and broaden horizons.
3. Personal Development: allows users to start a development plan within the organisation.
4. Support: allows users to provide general feedback, contact the L&D team and report a problem.

Supporting the above it is also important that users feel a sense of ownership of the portal. This is the employees window into their career and the values of the company. It is ever more crucial that the website becomes a central hub for company values and learning, particularly with employees spread across various global territories.
